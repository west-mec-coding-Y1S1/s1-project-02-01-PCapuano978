    bytes which the standard for HTML. Second, I added both a link to the documents jtc_base.css and 
    jtc_layout as guided by the instuctions. Similarly instructed, I added a title as well through the 
    tag of the same name which gives the page it's name on a browser tab. -->

            <blockquote> <p>I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. 
                    They did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up 
                    that same day. Great service.

                            an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid. 
                            I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.
